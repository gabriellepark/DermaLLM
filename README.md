## Motivation and Goal

The global beauty market is a multi-billion dollar industry, with skincare accounting for nearly half of total sales and continuing to grow every year. However, new products and trendy ingredients are constantly entering the market, making it increasingly difficult for consumers to know which products would best suit their individual needs. Whether someone is trying to address a specific skin concern, manage a condition like acne or eczema, or stay within a budget, navigating the skincare space can be overwhelming.

To address this challenge, we developed SkinWise. ** Our goal is to bridge the gap between complex skincare information and user-friendly recommendations by allowing users to ask questions and receive custom, easy-to-understand responses.**


# TO EDIT
## Architecture

The SkinWise workflow brings together rich skincare product and medical data and a powerful AI agent to meet users' individual needs:

# Project Workflow

1. **Data Input**
   - **Data Ingestion:** Import raw data from sources (CSV, SQL, APIs).
   - **Data Validation:** Check schema consistency and data types.
   - **Data Versioning:** Snapshot data for reproducibility.

2. **Data Analysis**
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize distributions and correlations.
   - **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, duplicates, and formatting errors.
   - **Feature Engineering:** Scale features, encode variables, and create new features.

3. **Model Training**
   - **Data Splitting:** Divide into training, validation, and testing sets.
   - **Algorithm Selection:** Choose baselines and complex models.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model configurations (Grid/Random Search).

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Performance Metrics:** Calculate Accuracy, F1-Score, RMSE, etc.
   - **Error Analysis:** Review confusion matrices and residual plots.
   - **Cross-Validation:** Verify generalization using k-fold validation.

5. **UI Interface**
   - **Frontend Design:** Build user inputs using frameworks (Streamlit, Flask).
   - **Backend Integration:** Connect frontend to model prediction APIs.
   - **Visualization:** Display predictions and probability scores clearly.

6. **Deployment**
   - **Containerization:** Package application with Docker.
   - **Hosting:** Deploy to cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).
   - **Monitoring:** Track performance and detect data drift.

## Dependencies

A2UI is designed to be a lightweight format, but it fits into a larger ecosystem:

* **Transports:** Compatible with **A2A Protocol** and **AG UI**.
* **LLMs:** Can be generated by any model capable of generating JSON output.
* **Host Frameworks:** Requires a host application built in a supported framework
(currently: Web or Flutter).
