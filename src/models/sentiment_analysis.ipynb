It\\u2019s thick, my sking does not absorb it properly and I  even dare say it\\u2019s a little sticky.The cleanser is good, but it\\u2019s not unique. There are other things that are better & cheaper. For that price point I expected much more.The toner is really good, it does work (up to a point) and it has a nice cold-ish feeling to it. ; 2. Love these products! I was using a random assortment of skincare products for my face (for acne/blemishes) but my face was still very oily during the day- I used to have to blot my face about six times a day. Within a few weeks of using this set I could tell a huge difference- my face is less oily, my pores look smaller and they all smell/feel amazing! My skin glows instead of shining and I\\u2019m extremely happy with this set. ; 3. I\\u2019ve purchased this set multiple times and my biggest issue was the pump bottle for the moisturizer they had before would always have product trapped in it and I couldn\\u2019t completely finish the bottle. I\\u2019m glad to see they took the set off the market, redesigned the moisturizer container to a little pot and brought it back to sephora! I really love this for my oily, acne-prone skin. I find the entire set has a lovely cooling sensation when I use it at the end of the night. I only took a star off because I do find the cleanser to be a little stripping, I can only use a tiny drop of it and I exfoliate it in my hands with water before applying. Otherwise this is a solid set! ; 4. This stuff worked wonders for my skin! I have very oily skin and I have been to a dermatologist plenty of times and they can never help me with my acne problem! This stuff though 10/10! It has cleared up my skin in just a week! I can\\u2019t wait to continue using this! ; 5. Been using for only 2 weeks. Not impressed so far. Skin still oily as ever and pores look the same. The moisturizer is super heavy. I don\\u2019t mind it for night but the toner plus the moisturizer during the day has made me even oilier.  I will continue to use it and see it what it does but so far it\\u2019s been a waste of money\",\n          \"1. I can not say enough good things about this product. I\\u2019ve been suffering from hormonal acne for the past year and have tried what feels like everything. As soon as I started using this face wash combined with the special cucumber lotion is when I started to see a significant improvement in my skin. I\\u2019m aware that the ingredients might be harsh but as long as you follow up with a good moisturizer all will be well. It\\u2019s been about 3 weeks and my skin is the clearest it\\u2019s been in a year. Give this a try and don\\u2019t let the negative reviews sway your decision. ; 2. Recently I have been having hellish hormonal breakouts and post acne scarring that would not go away and nothing would get rid of it but since I have been washing my face with the MB acne cleanser then I apply origins spot remover I follow with belif aqua bomb (because these acne treatments can be so skin drying) and finally I finish with the MB lavender and chamomile spray I have been doin this for a little over one week and I see a DRAMATIC difference in the overall appearance and texture of my face my face feels super smooth and my spots are slowly but surely lightening ; 3. I\\u2019ve been using this cleaner for about a week now and I\\u2019ve noticed an immediate difference in the quality of my skin. It leaves my skin super clean but not at all dehydrated, which is a problem I have had with other more expensive treatment cleansers. Using it with the glycolic acid toner has really helped my and residual redness. While I haven\\u2019t noticed a reduction in breakouts ( I have hormonal acne), these two products together heal spots almost overnight. Will definitely purchase again! ; 4. I have been using this acne cleanser for about 6 years now! It\\u2019s the only acne cleanser that has helped prevent cystic acne around my chin. I still occasionally get cystic acne around my chin because there\\u2019s that one night (or couple of nights) that I fall asleep with my makeup on. Thats my fault, obviously! But when using this product mornings and every night MY SKIN IS SO CLEAR. I also used to have a lot of acne around my forehead and this has helped so much! ; 5. This is great if you\\u2019re cleansing a naked face. The little make up I usually wear still gets left behind after using this, but it doesn\\u2019t irritate my skin. It is very gentle and is similar to cetaphil. The biggest turn off is the alcohol smell. Not sure if anyone else smells that when using this product! Overall: contains alcohol, but isn\\u2019t totally drying. Works for a bare face, and leaves behind make up if you are wearing any. If you\\u2019re going to get this, spend it on cetaphil which is $5-$10 cheaper.\",\n          \"1. I love this. A nice clay mask that tightens skin, dries quickly & doubles as a scrub when you wash it off. Also, a little goes a long way!! ; 2. After using this product, I\\u2019ve visibly noticed smaller pores and clearer skin. My face feels great after using this. ; 3. Excellent produit qui nettoie en profondeur et qui d\\u00e9loge les impuret\\u00e9s...je le recommande!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":42},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/jupyter_client/session.py:203: DeprecationWarning: datetime.datetime.utcnow() is deprecated and scheduled for removal in a future version.
